# Computer-Science-2
 A collection of software projects made during a course that focused on structured programming, software engineering concepts, and algorithm analysis. 

## Lab-1
###### Invoice
Allows users to input  item transaction information and utilizes it to generate an invoice application. 
###### Temperature
Allows users to input a temperature in Fahrenheit and converts it to Celsius. 
###### AlteredTemperature 
Allows user to choose the conversion wanted, then the program accepts an input from the user in order to calculate the chosen conversion and display the result. 
###### GuessingGame
A game that generates a random number between 0-100 and allows the player to guess the number by inputting their guess. If the guess is incorrect, the program provides feedback to help the player get the correct answer. 
###### Volume
Calculates the volume of multiple boxes based on the users’ input. 
###### Summation
Calculates the summation of integers from one to the number that the user has inputted. 

## Lab-2 
###### Testgrades
A program that gathers data on test grades and calculates the highest, lowest, and average of the test grades inputted. The program is displayed using a graphical user interface (GUI). 
###### AlteredTestgrades 
Same program as “Testgrades” except instead of gathering input from the user, it gathers the data from a file that it reads. 

## Lab-3
A program that accepts an unlimited amount of number input from the user until specified otherwise. The program will sort and store each input according to numerical order as it receives it. 

## Lab-4 
###### Recursion1
Utilizes recursion to create functions that can solve factorial, exponential, summation, and greatest common divisor problems. The program allows the user to choose a function and input the values they want to solve the function with and displays the solved result. 

###### Tobinary 
Uses recursion to convert a decimal number to its binary number equivalent. The program allows the user to input the decimal number they would like to have converted and displays the solved result. 

## Lab-5 
Created a program with bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicks sort functions and applied these sorting functions on multiple data sets to observe and compare the speed of sorting when using different methods. 

## Lab-6
A program that reads in a list of names from a file and allows the user to add in additional names to the file if wanted and/or search for names in the list. The program will sort the names in alphabetical order before saving to update the file with the new list.

## Lab-7
Designed a fully functional linked list with methods to add, remove, and get data from the list. The program handles exceptions, uses an iterator to get all values from the list, and accepts unlimited number input from the user. Test cases were used to demonstrate functionality, and the iterator’s functionality was shown through using it to find the total sum of the data in the linked list. 

## Lab-8
Created a bank teller interface that allows customers to log in and deposit, withdraw, or check their balances. The accounts will update as needed due to the users’ transactions and automatically save the updated info to the database/file that holds the account info when the user is done.
